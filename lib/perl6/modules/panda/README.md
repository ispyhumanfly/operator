# Panda

![Panda](http://modules.perl6.org/panda.png) Panda is a Perl 6 module manager.

## Installation

To install Panda along with all its dependencies, simply run the script
bootstrap.pl in the root of the panda git repo. You must have
perl6 installed in order to run bootstrap.pl

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/tadzik/panda.git

    cd panda

    perl6 bootstrap.pl

Since the bootstrap step currently runs tests with prove, you will need a
recent TAP::Harness (3.x) for it to work properly.

After a successful bootstrap, a message will show up saying what path should be added
to PATH env variable in order to be able to run panda from the command line. For example:

==> Please make sure that /home/user/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site/bin is in your PATH

If you use bash, you can fulfill that requirement with the following:

    echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/rakudo/install/share/perl6/site/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc


## Running Tests

One way to run the test suite is with prove from TAP::Harness

    prove -e perl6 -lrv t/
    # or on windows: prove -e "perl6 -lrv" t/

You will need a recent TAP::Harness (3.x) to have a prove binary with an -e option.

## Usage

Panda can be used like:

    panda install Task::Star

([Task::Star](https://github.com/tadzik/Task-Star/) is a handy bundle that installs all the modules shipped with the Rakudo Star PerlÂ 6 distribution.)

Alternatively, you can install a package from the local disk by supplying its path:

    panda install ./perl6-Acme-Meow

You can also specify a git repository and panda will automatically fetch
the code from it. It's also possible to specify a commit to checkout:

    panda install git://github.com/tadzik/Net--IRC.git
    # or
    panda install git://github.com/tadzik/Net--IRC.git@3c5ca0db791d9ec

If you are behind a proxy, you need to [configure git](http://help.github.com/firewalls-and-proxies/) and have HTTP::UserAgent installed which
supports proxies. Panda's built-in HTTP client does not.

You can also use the GIT_PROTOCOL environment variable to specify another
protocol if git is blocked on your network:

    GIT_PROTOCOL=https panda install Acme::Meow
